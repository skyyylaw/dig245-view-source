<h1>DIG 245 View Source</h1>

<p class="intro">This is an introduction to view source (using Chrome):</p>

<div class="instructions">
  <p id='tutorial'>Tutorial:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open Chrome and open a website of your choice</li>
    <li>Right click on anywhere on the website page and click on either "View page source" or "Inspect"
        in the dropout menu (while "View page source" allow you to see the plain website source code,
        "Inspect" allows you to check elements by elements by the website and let you directly see which
        segments of codes correspond to which part of the visual website)</li>
    <li>We will be looking at "Inspect". After you open the tool, you should see something like this:</li>
    <img src="assets/img/view-source.png" alt="Image of inspect page" width="455" height="230">
    <li>As you select elements in the "element" tab of the inspect page, the actual visual content in the
      website will be highlighted on the right so you know which segment of codes produce which part of the
      visual website. How cool is that!</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="tips">
  <p id="tips-title">What else you could do with the Inspect developer tool?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you select this button
        <img src="assets/img/page-element-inspect.png" alt="page-element-inspect-button" width="20" height="20">
         you will be able to see the corresponding codes in the inspect page to the elements of webpage that
         your mouse cursor is hovering on</li>
    <li>If you select this button
        <img src="assets/img/device-size.png" alt="device-size button" width="20" height="20">
        you will be able to change the device type/size on which this webpage will be viewed and
        see the visual outcome of the webpage. It would be very useful for webpage developers to
        ensure their website is usable and viewable on different sizes and types of devices</li>
    <li>If you select an element in the Inspect-Element tab, you could actually add, edit or delete an element!
        You will also get live update on the changes you have done to the website so you can experiement with it!</li>
  </ul>
